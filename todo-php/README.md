## About the Realtime Cloud Storage Service
Part of the [The RealtimeÂ® Framework](http://framework.realtime.co), the Realtime Cloud Storage Service is a highly-scalable backend-as-a-service powered by Amazon DynamoDB. We've added real-time notifications to keep data synchronized between users of your application.

## Storage table definition

- Primary Key: listName (string)
- Secondary Key: timestamp (number)

## Security note

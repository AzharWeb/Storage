## Angry Admin: A multi-player mobile game built with Realtime iOS SDK
The Realtime Angry Admin is a game developed with the purpose of demonstrating that you can use Realtime Framework to develop real-time collaborative games.
In this game we use both Realtime Framework services: the Realtime Cloud Storage for data persistence, for example the game's scores, and Realtime Cloud Messaging, for syncing the game in real-time between players. Mobile Push Notifications are used to notify users of new game challenges by other players.

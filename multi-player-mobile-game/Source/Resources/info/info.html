	<h1>Realtime Angry Admin</h1>
	<h2>Realtime Framework multi-player mobile game example</h2>
	
	
	<p>Every developer knows that System Administrators can easily lose their temper and be a pain in the neck. Can't live with them but seriously can't live without them either.
	This is our homage to them and in particular to our own SysAdmins team leader at Realtime.</p>
	<p>In this game you can unleash your Angry Admin and throw him to make damage to your opponent friends. Players lose when the rock falls over their cannons.</p>
	
	
	<p>Every player has a game Id that identifies their game (4 letters). Give yours to your friends so they will be able to play with you. You may also invite your friends by inserting their game Ids.</p>

	<p>This game acts as an example to show how you can use the <a href="http://framework.realtime.co">Realtime® Framework</a> to build a real-time multi-player mobile game.

	In this game we use both of the Realtime® Framework products: <a href="http://framework.realtime.co/storage/">STORAGE</a> (Realtime Cloud Storage for data persistence, like the scores) and <a href="http://framework.realtime.co/messaging/">MESSAGING</a> (Realtime Cloud Messaging for the game real-time syncing between players). We also make use of <a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/">Cocos2D</a> (cocos2d-iphone is a framework for building 2D games) and <a href="http://www.spritebuilder.com/">Sprite Builder</a></p>

	<p>For more details check the complete source code at <a href="https://github.com/realtime-framework/Storage/tree/master/multi-player-mobile-game">GitHub</a> and the development guide tutorial <a href="http://framework.realtime.co/blog/building-a-multiplayer-mobile-game.html">blog post.</a></p>

	<h3>May the best Angry Admin win.</h3>
